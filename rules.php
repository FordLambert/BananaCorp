            <li>Be polite: thank you to avoid insults or inappropriate remarks, don't forget it's just a game (even if someone stole your c4 while you were pissing)</li>
            <li>This is a PVP server and Raids are always authorised</li>
            <li>During a Raid, don't destroy more things than necessary: break all you need to go in, steal everything you can and go back home without breaking useless things, without breaking or locking the cupboard</br>
            and without killing sleepers</li>
            <li>Given the above rule, it's forbidden to steal the house of another player</li>
            <li>The admin is a player like everyone else: commands will only serve in case of problem or to be sure a plugin is working the way it should</br>
            In no case to get free stuff or break in noclip in your home and draw dirty things on the wall (except if you invit me to do it of course)</li>
            <li>The non respect of these rules will be punish by the Admin</li>
          </ul>
          </br>
